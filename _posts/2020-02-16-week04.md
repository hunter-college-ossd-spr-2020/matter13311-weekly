#### Some projects I have looked at include: 
* [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
* [Microsoft visual studio code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
* [Inkscape](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape)
* [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)
* [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)

#### Projects I eliminated: 
1. **Jupyter**  
   The reason I eliminated this is because it isn't in the realm of anything I'm familiar with. I have not ever used Jupyter, and I am still not entirely 100% sure what their program is used for. 
1. **Godot**  
   I never used this game engine, and also seeing that they have more than a million lines of code makes it a bit intimidating and not a good place to start

#### Candidates: 
* Bootstrap
* Microsoft visual studio code
* Inkscape

#### Promising: 
* Bootstrap
* Inkscape  

The reason I decided Bootstrap and Inkscape are promising is because I have used these programs before so I am familiar with how to use them. The reason I did not add visual studio code is because I can see that the project is not really active. The most recent changes are a few days old. And in my opinion, I don't think VS code needs anymore improvement. Bootstrap and Inkscape on the other hand looks more active. 

#### Contribution's I've made:
* On openstreets map, I added some more information for the bus stop that I regularly take. I added whether there are benches or shelter, and some descriptions
